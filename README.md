## Introduction

Welcome to the Binary Image Segmentation Project! Binary segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves partitioning an image into two regions: foreground and background. In this project, we focus on developing algorithms and tools for accurately separating objects of interest from the background in images.

Binary segmentation plays a crucial role in various applications across different domains, including medical imaging, satellite image analysis, autonomous driving, and more. By accurately segmenting images into foreground and background regions, we can extract meaningful information and enable further analysis and decision-making processes.
